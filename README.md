New #``deeplearning`` ``computervision`` Project, Hand Sign Detection ( #``objectdetection`` ) using #``YOLOv7`` model... ðŸ˜€
1. Trained the model with my own data, which is #``annotated`` by #``RoboFlow``
2. Get the #``yolov7`` from it's official ``#github`` account, where I used *``yolov7x.pt``* model
3. Trained the model with 88 images:
        [ Training Set: 65 images,
          Validation Set: 18 images,
          Testing Set: 5 images ] with **200 epochs**, **16 batch** size and **640 image** size.
4. For Training I used ``#googlecolab`` #gpu..
